# Osirion Replay Uploader
> the official desktop app for windows ðŸ’š

the osirion uploader app automates replay uploading, so you can get your match data into the app right away.


## How to install

normally, you would install the app from our web app.

if you, for some reason, have issues with that, you can find the `.msi` file under the "Releases" section here.


## About the app

the app is designed to run in the background while you play.

it will *not* cause performance issues. you will not notice any lag or issues because of this app, so no need to worry about that.

the app lives only in the system tray, and does *not* have a user interface.
the only interface is a menu you can open by `right-click`ing.


because of that, it only consumes ~3MB of memory, which is less than most built-in Windows background services.
